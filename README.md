objective:
The objective of this project is to demonstrate basic implementation of a chat application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases how user input can be processed and responded to using predefined patterns, mimicking a conversation between a user and a bot.

Key Activities:
User Input Handling: Capture user messages when they press Enter in the input field (#user-input).

Message Display: Display user messages and bot responses in the #chat-output container. Messages are styled differently based on whether they are from the user (user-message) or the bot (bot-message).

Bot Response Generation: The bot generates responses based on predefined keywords using the getResponse function. If a user message contains a recognized keyword (e.g., "hello"), the bot responds accordingly.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Provides the structure and basic elements of the web page.
CSS: Styles the HTML elements to create a visually appealing chat interface.
JavaScript: Implements the functionality of capturing user input, generating bot responses, and updating the UI dynamically.

Conclusion:
This project serves as a foundational example of how to build a basic chat application using fundamental web technologies. It illustrates how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can work together to create a functional user interface that responds dynamically to user input.
